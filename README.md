# JavaScript: THE FUNDAMENTALS

:computer:After listening to the most recent Syntax.fm podcast detailing the Fundamentals of JavaScript, I realised I needed to ~~learn~~ brush up! It is a damned good episode and well worth a listen->->-> [Syntax.fm show 162](https://syntax.fm/show/162/the-fundamentals-js). 

I’ve made myself a bit of a checklist here and wanted to share in case anyone else would find it remotely useful. Please feel free to add/correct any of the below via PR. As I go through and delve into all of these things, I will be linking to the resources I find most useful for getting to grips with these fundamentals. Similarly, feel free to suggest your own :smile:

## Variables!
Know your var from your let from your const! Know the scope of each and when to use them.

## Scoping!
Understand where and when variables are available to you based on when they have been created and used. The differences between block and function scope. How the scope lookup works.

## Types!
What are the seven types of value available to you in JavaScript?

## Functions!
What are the different types of function, how are they used and why? Understand the scope that comes along with each. Know the difference between a function and a method as well as how they interact.

## The DOM! 
Understand how the raw dom works and practice interfacing with elements via JS.  Know the difference between a node and an element.

## Object.prototype! 
How does it work and know what “this” is equal to at any given point.

## Events! 
Know how events work in real-world use cases. Know the use of Click, Mouse, and Pointer events. Try dispatching your own custom events.

## Bubbling and propagation! 
How and why do those work.

## Array Methods! 
Understand arrays themselves, and how to manipulate them. Push, pop, slice, splice. Have a good grasp of when to change an existing array and when to create a new one, as well as when to use an array vs object. Mutation vs immutability in general is good stuff to know!

## Flow control!
Knowing how to order and condition things properly and efficiently is key! You need to know about the different ways of Looping and how they work.

## Truthy and falsy!
Know how these differ from true and false and the use cases for each.

##	Security, accessibility, and XSS! 
You want at least a basic understanding of how domains are communicating and what they have reciprocal access to, as well as API requests, headers and responses. Gain a good foundation into accessibility so as not to accidentally exclude a valuable portion of your users! 

![Found a job where they care about accessibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLY93/JSFundamentals/master/images/accessibility.jpg)

## Modules! 
Know at least Import, export and named vs default. Understand that modules have their own scope and can share data from one to another.

## Closures! 
What is a closure? What they do? And why they might be useful?

![Now that is closure!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLY93/JSFundamentals/master/images/closure.gif)

## Requests!
Know how to obtain data from an API, parse it, and use it via JSON or GraphQL.

![A Billion API requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLY93/JSFundamentals/master/images/api.jpg)

##	JSON! 
You should be able to explain what it is, how, and why it is used. 

![When a third party API sends XML instead of JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLY93/JSFundamentals/master/images/json.jpeg)

## Clean Code! 
Have a decent repertoire of best practices in clean code to underpin and supplement all your new-found JavaScript knowledge!
